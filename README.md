# Program to automate the analysis of an Excel spreadsheet and send the report by e-mail

The project was developed during the intensive course held by [Hashtag Treinamentos](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com), with the objective of introducing the creation of applications to automate processes or systems for companies.
