# Program to automate the analysis of an Excel spreadsheet and send the report by e-mail
The project was developed during the intensive course held by [Hashtag Treinamentos](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com), with the objective of introducing the creation of applications to automate processes or systems for companies.

## üî® Project functionality
The program performs autonomously (without the need of a person's supervision) the action of opening the browser, accessing the Excel spreadsheet, analyzing the data, and sending a report by e-mail, with the intention of facilitating some processes for a certain company. 

**Note:** To use the program on different monitors, you must change the position (x and y) of the commands.
